zzzzzzzzzzzz (that's 12, if you're counting) is a simple action side-scroller
that places you in an alternate dimension where you have no defense and no way
to traverse but to move your body and reverse gravity.

Keys:
	Movement: (left/right arrows) move your character left and right
			  (z) reverse gravity!
			  (p) access in-game menu
			  (q) quit game
